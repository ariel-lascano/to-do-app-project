Before run:
1) Update connection string in appsettings.json
2) Restore repository.bak

Info: 
- Default startup page list all entries in database
- EntityFramework is used as bridge between runtime-dto-object and database, in this way I can avoid low level operations such as 
write query manual for get data and any other operation

- ItemsController manage CRUD operations:
	- Startup uri/READ ALL: http://localhost:5118/items
	- CREATE using POST
	- READ by ID: http://localhost:5118/items/3
	- UPDATE using POST
	- DELETE by ID: http://localhost:5118/items/delete/3

*** About database
- in 'Database' directory you can find query used for create data table 'dbo.data' and a stored query for fill 
	table adding sample data.

- repository.bak is backup file used for todo-data if you wish to restore it, connection string has been define in apssettings.json 

- actions on database, for tests, has been executed using SQL SERVER MANAGEMENT STUDIO

*** About WebAPI solution

- Default startup page list all entries in database

- DTO is ToDoItem, it maps database table structure

- EntityFramework is used as bridge between runtime-dto-object and database, in this way I can avoid low level operations such as 
write query manual for get data and any other operation

- ItemsController manage CRUD operations, READ and DELETE works also from browser:

	- Startup uri/READ ALL: http://localhost:5118/items
	- READ by ID: http://localhost:5118/items/3
	- DELETE by ID: http://localhost:5118/items/delete/3

Has been also defined 2 methods for create and update picking data from body of http request, tested using PostMan.
